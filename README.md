# Unity5_CatWalks_111316
This is a cat walk game with Unity5 and C#
I put many sprites and made three scripts.


<Three Scripts explanation below>
1.PlayerControllers.cs describes the main character behavior
2.ClearDirector.cs descrives the other page when you reached goal by touching treasure chest. 
3.CameraController.cs describes to make camera moving centering the character.
